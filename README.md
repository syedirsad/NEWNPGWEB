# NEET Physics Gujarati - Learning Portal

This project is an interactive learning portal for NEET Physics preparation. It's built with React, TypeScript, and Vite for a fast, reliable, and scalable development experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or newer) and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate into the project directory.
3.  Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode. Open the local address shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles and optimizes your code for the best performance. This is the command that Netlify will use.

## Deployment to Netlify

If your site is already connected to a GitHub repository on Netlify, ensure the build settings are configured as follows:

1.  **Build command:** `npm run build`
2.  **Publish directory:** `dist`

Pushing your updated code to the connected GitHub branch will trigger a new build and deploy your site automatically.
